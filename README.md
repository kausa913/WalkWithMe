# WalkWithMe
Walk with me is an AR telepresence app that aims to change the way we interact with our friends and loved ones seperated by distance. Walk with me tracks your friends position and orientation (across the globe) in real time and augments their footprints right next to you. Discover new forms of interaction emerge between people in this virtually shared space.
